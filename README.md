Mike's Virtual Amp
This is my custom program for COS10009 (Introduction to Programming) unit in my first semester of my first year at Swinburne Vietnam. The program was made with Python in a limited time period, so there are a lot of features that I planned to 
add but didn't have time to fully implement them all. 

Main Features
The program consists of an audio processing system with a guitar plugged into the computer as the audio input and the computerâ€™s speaker as the audio output, equalizer configurations (Treble, Mid, Bass) on the amplifier interface, and master 
and gain volume controls for simulating a real guitar amplifier. There is also an overdrive pedal that can be configured to add more gain to the current sound output. Another feature is an audio recorder that can be used to record the sound 
output and store the audio file in a folder on the computer.

HOW TO RUN
- This program requires Anaconda environment (https://www.anaconda.com)
- After Anaconda is installed, open the program with VS Code inside Anaconda environment
- Install all the required libraries in the file 
- Run the program with the command "python amp.py" in the terminal
Enjoy!
